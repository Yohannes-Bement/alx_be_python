# Defining the variables
principal = 1000  # The initial investment
rate = 0.05       # The annual interest rate (5%)
time = 3          # The time period in years

# Calculating the simple interest
interest = principal * rate * time

# Printing the result
print(f"The simple interest is: {interest}")
